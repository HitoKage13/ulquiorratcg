            new Post(2,"05/02/19","A Dangerous Rogue Away From Victory",`The past weekend,
            I was lucky enough to gain a top 8 and top 4 placing at Maitland and Penrith
            respectively. At both tournaments, I played two variants of the tried-and-true
            Zoroark/Lycanroc deck; each to counter the expected meta. It is clear that
            Zoroark/Lycanroc is the BDIF of the SUM-LOT format, having innate consistency
            and strong mid-game and late-game potential. My base list will be up on my decks
            profile very soon, with each tech change explained below. </br> </br>
            <b>Maitland Cup</b> </br> </br> Tech Changes: </br> -1 Max Potion </br> -1 Multi Switch
            </br> +1 Oranguru </br> +1 Bodybuilding Dumbbells </br> </br> Expectations:
            Lost March, Spread Malamar, GasKan </br> </br> Lost March WW </br> ZoroRoc/Vile WLT
            </br> GasKan WW </br> ZoroRoc/Vile WLW </br> ID </br> T8: BuzzGarb Shrine LL </br>
            </br> From my experiences at Newcastle LC the month prior, I believed
            that these decks will come in larger numbers due to their popularity
            in the Central Coast region. The decks were very easy to play, with
            Spread Malamar more of a counter brought by Sydney players to deal
            with the low HP single prize meta. I was fortunate enough to make
            top cut safely through a combination of luck and knowledge of the matchups.
            Unfortunately, my tournament run ended with a hard counter in top 8 with
            no outs to winning (mostly due to the fact that I didn't run Weavile).
            </br> </br> The Bodybuilding Dumbbells came in clutch in round 1 to Lost March,
            which enabled Zoroark-GXs to survive a 240 damage Lost March attack.
            However, its primary purpose was against GasKan; as with Alolan Muk
            and Dumbbells on a Zoroark-GX, it walled Marshadow-GX from attacking
            and required Necrozma-GX to have 5 Psychic Energies to OHKO. Although
            I played against 1 GasKan, I wasn't able to abuse this combo and instead
            had to play out the prize race. The Oranguru was added as a last minute
            call to counter Mill brought by two top Sydney players, however proved
            to be a useless card in the tournament.
            </br> </br> </b>Penrith Cup</b> </br>
            </br> Tech Changes: </br> -1 Rockruff </br> -1 Tapu Lele-GX
            </br> -1 Giratina </br> -1 Max Potion </br> -4 Fighting Energy
            </br> +1-1 Weavile </br> +1 Sableye </br> +1 Oranguru
            </br> +4 Unit Energy FDY </br> </br> </br> Expectations: Mill,
            ZoroRoc, Spread Malamar </br> </br> ZoroRoc WW </br> ZoroDeciTales WW
            </br> Spread Malamar WLW </br> ID </br> ID </br> T4: Spread Malamar LWL
            </br> </br> After the success of Mill (winning the tournament),
            Brent and my focus changed to finding a way to beat it; which came in the
            form of Sableye and Oranguru. The win condition was quite convoluted,
            which required Sableye to use Limitation to lock the opponent from using
            Supporters (disabling many of the Energy removal and win conditions).
            Furthermore, Oranguru could be used late game alongside a Judge to
            recover the Energies lost to removal and set up the Sableye lock again.
            The purpose of Oranguru with Sableye was very strong against Mill, as
            they would very likely deck out at that point. In the scenario they
            played Switch to use Unown HAND to win, Alolan Muk can be a counterplay
            in order to block that win condition. I also used Weavile to increase my
            matchups against GasKan, mirror and Buzz Shrine, yet it came in handy
            against ZoroDeciTales too. I managed to make it into top 4, whilst Brent
            failed with the same 60 due to variance and dead draws, but once again,
            I fail to make it past the first round of top cut; even though the mistake
            was due to my own misplays. My opponent deserved to win regardless and went
            on to win the tournament. </br> </br> It may be the time to retire ZoroRoc,
            due to my excessive usage of it this season. Although it's easily a strong
            play, I may still consider it for Top Ryde; playing a variety of decks
            can also help improve my analytical skills and achieve better results
            than I would hope. In terms of the Germany IC race, I am now ranked
            7th or 8th going into the second weekend of cups, with 2 placings
            secured. It is now a matter of getting further into top cut (first
            or second) in order to improve my standing, but I'm definitely
            feeling the effects of 'every point matters'. We'll see how
            it goes soon enough!`, ["Tournament Report"]),
            new Post(1,"22/01/19","Q2 Cups",`I have 4 League Cups coming up,
            all of which are important to my Germany IC goal. With an excess of 2 tournaments,
            I can afford to play a complex deck in one of them to try and squeeze out a stronger run.
            Some decks I've considered are: Passimian Spread, Malamar Spread,
            GasKan and Zoroark/Lycanroc.
            </br>
            </br> Cup 1: Maitland - Buzzwole, Lost March
            </br> Cup 2: Penrith - Zoroark, Blacephalon, Gardevoir
            </br> Cup 3: Newcastle - Buzzwole, Lost March
            </br> Cup 4: Top Ryde - Zoroark, Malamar, Blacephalon
            </br>
            </br> Passimian Spread: Great matchups against Zoroark variants, Blacephalon
            and GasKan; decks I believe will be popular in the first cup. My teammate,
            Christian Hasbani, showed me the deck and list late in December
            and has been popular in Queensland tournament this month.
            </br>
            </br> Malamar Spread: The deck is great against the Newcastle meta and
            has a lot of ways to cheese out wins against every matchup.
            </br>
            </br> GasKan: Christian built the list and is a strong
            and safe contender for an easy Top 8. It has some weaknesses to Spread unfortunately,
            but it should be enough to get wins against top decks.
            </br>
            </br> Zoroark/Lycanroc: A very safe deck that has 50-50 against the field
            and a deck I am truly comfortable with from a top 16 finish at Brisbane
            Regionals this season.
            The new list runs Alolan Muk to provide a favourable matchup vs GasKan,
            Granbull, mill; but struggles against the new Wailord & Magikarp Tag Team.
            </br>
            </br> The lists will be added to the decks tab soon. Stay tuned!`, ["Testing"]),
